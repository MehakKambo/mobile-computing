# HW0 - Getting Started

**Intended Platform:**  
- iOS

**Intended Framework/Programming Language:**  
- React Native

**Interest in Cross-Platform Development:**  
- Yes, I am interested in exploring cross-platform development.

**Reason for Selections:**  
- I chose iOS as the primary platform because Iâ€™ve heard it presents more challenges compared to Android development, and I want to tackle them to deepen my skills.
- Using React Native allows me to build applications for both iOS and Android with a single codebase, making it easy for cross-platform development. 
- Using React Native for the development allows me to leverage JavaScript, a language I'm already familiar with, which will allow me to reduce development time and effort.
